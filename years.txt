Finals Recap		The 2006 NBA Finals was the championship series of the 2005–06 National Basketball Association season. The Miami Heat won the title in six games over the Dallas Mavericks, becoming the third team—after the 1969 Celtics and the 1977 Trail Blazers—to win a championship after trailing 0–2 in the series. Heat guard Dwyane Wade was named Most Valuable Player of the series.[1]

This series marked the first time since 1971 that the Finals featured both teams playing in their first NBA Finals series. Both teams met in the 2011 Finals, the second Finals appearance for both franchises, with the Mavericks winning the rematch over the Heat.

This was the second matchup of teams from Florida and Texas, after the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic contested the 1995 NBA Finals.

This was the only Finals not to involve the Los Angeles Lakers or San Antonio Spurs between 1999 and 2010.
