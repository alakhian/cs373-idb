Syscall of the Wild Critique

What did they do well?
	1. Creating pages that flow well with each other, providing multiple links between cuisines,
	reviewers, dishes, and restaurants
	2. Providing a generic dish page that gives the user access to multiple restaurants if 
	they're "in the mood" for a certain dish.
	3. They did a good job of providing links to multiple restaurants who offer different types of 
	cuisines through the website's dishes menu.

What did we learn from their website?
	1.

What can they do better?
	1. On the website, the reviews give a text description, but they offer no visual evaluation.
	In the API those reviews have a Cost Rating and a Quality Rating, and it'd be nice as a user
	to see those with the text review.

	2. Having a colored bar depicting the average rating for dishes was a good idea, but since
	a lot of them indicate a 0, it ends up looking like most of the dishes get horrible reviews
	and shouldn't be eaten.

What puzzles us about their website?
	1. The pictures that scroll near the top of the webpage link to restaurants, but sometimes not
 	the restaurant depicted (sign of Magnolia Cafe links to Hyde Park and Grill).

	2. Each dish has reviews but there's no numerical indication (0-5 stars) of what their text
 	review
